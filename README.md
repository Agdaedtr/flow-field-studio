# Flow Field Studio

An interactive generative-art studio that runs entirely in your browser. Thousands of particles drift through a seeded Perlin-style **flow field**, leaving fading trails that bloom into organic, ever-changing artwork. Tune the field, steer the swarm with your cursor, and export a poster-quality PNG.

## Features

- **Real-time flow field** â particles are advected through 3D value noise that slowly evolves over time, so the piece never stops changing.
- **Eight curated palettes** â Aurora, Ember, Verdant, Mono, Candy, Sunset, Ocean, and Magma.
- **Live controls** â particle count, flow scale, speed, curl, stroke width, and trail fade, all adjustable on the fly.
- **Cursor force** â drag on the canvas to attract or repel the swarm.
- **Reproducible seeds** â "New seed" reshapes the entire field; the PRNG is seedable so a field can be recreated.
- **One-click PNG export** â save the current frame at full resolution.
- **Zero dependencies, zero network** â one HTML file, one stylesheet, one script. Everything runs locally.
- **Responsive + theming** â works on phones, supports light/dark via the OS preference or a `?theme=` query param.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key     | Action      |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `Space` | Play / pause |
| `R`     | New seed     |
| `C`     | Clear canvas |
| `S`     | Save PNG     |

## Run locally

No build step. Just serve the folder with any static server:

```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# or Node
npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

## How it works

Each particle samples a smoothly-varying noise field at its position to get a flow angle, steps forward along that angle, and draws a short line segment. A faint translucent wash is painted over the canvas every frame, so older segments fade out and create the characteristic streaking trails. The noise field's third dimension is animated over time, which makes the whole field slowly breathe. See [`app.js`](app.js) â it is small and commented.
